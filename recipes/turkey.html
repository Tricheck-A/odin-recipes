    <h1>Thanksgiving Turkey</h1>
    <img src="./img/turkey.jpeg" width="300" alt="Picture of a Thanksgiving Turkey">
    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>A perfectly seasoned and juicy turkey. My friend from France taught me to cook turkey like this, <br>
        but she never measures anything so use your own judgment for vegetable amounts, etc. <br>
        I usually err on the side of 'more is better'! </p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed  </li>
        <li>22 cups kosher salt  </li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter, melted   </li>
        <li>2 large onions, peeled and chopped   </li>
        <li>4 carrots, peeled and chopped </li>
        <li>4 stalks celery, chopped </li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme </li>
        <li>1 bay leaf </li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Step</strong> <br>
            Rub the turkey inside and out with the kosher salt. Place the bird in a large stock pot,<br>
            and cover with cold water. Place in the refrigerator, and allow the turkey to soak in the <br>
            salt and water mixture 12 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <br>
        <li> <strong>Step</strong> <br>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly rinse the turkey, and <br>
            discard the brine mixture. </li>
            <br>
        <li> <strong>Step</strong> <br>
            Brush the turkey with 1/2 the melted butter. Place breast side down on a roasting rack <br>
            in a shallow roasting pan. Stuff the turkey cavity with 1 onion, 1/2 the carrots, 1/2 the <br>
            celery, 1 sprig of thyme, and the bay leaf. Scatter the remaining vegetables and thyme <br>
            around the bottom of the roasting pan, and cover with the white wine.</li>
            <br>
        <li> <strong>Step</strong> <br>
            Roast uncovered 3 1/2 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until the internal <br> 
            temperature of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F (85 degrees C). Carefully turn the <br>
            turkey breast side up about 2/3 through the roasting time, and brush with the <br>
            remaining butter. Allow the bird to stand about 30 minutes before carving.</li>
    </ol>
